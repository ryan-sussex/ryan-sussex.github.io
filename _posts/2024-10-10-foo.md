## Motivating Example

Typically in Decision/ Control we wish to minimise some performance index, lets call it $J(x)$,  $J: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ . Over some set of probability measures $\{p_{a}(x): a \in \mathcal{A}\}$ indicating our actions, or decision variables. 

$$
a^* \in \arg\max_{a} \mathbb{E}_{p_{a}(x)}[J(x)]
$$

We are often in the situation where we know how the distribution up to some parameters (which represent some latent information) i.e. we have $p(x \mid a, \theta)$. Now the Bayesian philosophy, with support from the complete class theorem indicates we should place a prior $p(\theta)$ indicating our probabilistic belief about the latent states. We can then minimise 

$$
a^* \in \arg\max_{a} \mathbb{E}_{p_{a}(x, \theta)}[J(x)]
$$

However a different philosophy is to ensure robustness over a certain range, this means taking the action that yields the best worst-case scenario:

$$
a^* \in \arg\max_{a}\min_{\theta \in \Theta} \mathbb{E}_{p_{a}(x \mid \theta)}[J(x)]
$$

Lets call the $J_m(a, \theta)=\mathbb{E}_{p_{a}(x, \mid \theta)}[J(x)]$, it is clear that one interpretation of this objective is a two player zero-sum game where the agent gets to choose an action and the world also gets to choose an action (the value of $\theta)$.  Although the world also has the added advantage of seeing what move you played *before* deciding itâ€™s own move. This extremely pessimistic, which we will return to later.

Another way of introducing pessimism is to have a so-called risk-sensitive utility function. One of the most common is the exponentiated utility: $U(\cdot) = e^{\tau(\cdot)}$.  The exponential function breaks the linearity of the original expected objective. 

To illustrate, suppose we were in a finite world $X=\{x_i\}_{i\in[N]}$  then for some specific action  

$\mathbb{E}_{p_{a}(x)}[J(x)] = \sum_{i} p_iJ_i$
