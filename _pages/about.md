<!-- Modelling intelligence in human minds and machines through the lens of Bayesian inference, Predictive Coding, Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle. -->
I am generally interested in ideas related to the Bayesian brain hypothesis; particularly predictive coding and active inference. More broadly, the use of Dynamical Systems and Information Theory to understand cognitive phenomena. I am especially interested in exploring how these can be used to understand the trade-offs inherent in decision making with constrained resources.    

I am currently a PhD candidate under Christopher Buckley. Previously, I graduated from Wadham College, Oxford with undergraduate and masters degrees in Mathematics. I then worked for a small Machine Learning start up for a few years, before returning to study with a renewed interest in the intersection between machine learning and biological intelligence.
